    `${capitalizedFeature} needs *${toolName}* but Nuclide couldn't find it at \`${command}\`.

**Troubleshooting Tips**
1. Make sure that *${toolName}* is installed. Some Nuclide features require tools that aren't
   bundled with Nuclide. You may need to install this tool yourself.
2. Make sure that *${toolName}* can be run using the command \`${command}\`.
3. Atom doesn't know about PATH modifications made in your shell config (".bash_profile", ".zshrc",
   etc.). If *${toolName}* is installed and you can run it successfully from your terminal using the
   command \`${command}\`, Nuclide may just not be looking in the right place. Update the command by
   changing the **${maybeToString(settingTitle)}** setting (under **${categoryTitle}**) on the
   Nuclide settings page.`;

  return {
    message: `Nuclide couldn't find *${toolName}*!`,
    meta: {
      dismissable: true,
      description,
    },
  };
}
